I was given 5 minutes in which to do this, which makes this a very difficult job because I could talk all day about my time at the foundation and the incredible children there.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>What moved me? Why did I want to help others?<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So the story is; Despite having an incredible job working for the Premier League and spending most of my days watching and talking about football, every man\u2019s dream right, something did not feel right.<\/p>\n<p>Life was easy, I had good money, lots of friends and family, but I had this overwhelming feeling that I was not contributing to society in a positive way.\u00a0I\u2019d spent my whole life thinking only of myself and what it was I needed to do to better myself.<\/p>\n<p>Travelling opened my eyes to many inequalities that exist in the world today which whilst in my bubble in London were difficult to see and understand. Travelling exposed me to these.<\/p>\n<p>Is it fair that there are millions of people in this world who do not have access to clean water? Is it fair that there are millions of people without homes and basic shelter? Is it fair that there are millions of people starving to death?<\/p>\n<p>So I ask you;<\/p>\n<p>Would you rather have $100million US dollars and live in luxury but everyone else around you has absolutely nothing and live in squalor? or\u00a0would you rather live in an environment where poverty did not exist, where everyone had access to clean water, food and a roof over their head?<\/p>\n<p>What is the point in me having all this wealth if all around me I see misery, pain and unhappiness? I know which options makes me happier!<\/p>\n<p>Could I go back to my bubble in London and pretend everything was ok? Impossible.<br \/>\nThis was the catalyst to want to do something more positive with my time, energy and education.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>What did I get from this experience?<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Unimaginable levels of love and happiness would summarise this well.<\/p>\n<p>I think the kids taught me more than I taught them. I learned so much from them. Things like unconditional love. Kids don\u2019t prejudice anyone, they just love. It doesn\u2019t matter if your black, white, Chinese, English, a man or woman, none of this matters to a kid, they just love and seeing these kids help each other, look after each other, laugh and play, was deeply moving.<\/p>\n<p>So Whilst I thought my life was full, complete and happy before this experience, the kids have taught me that this is far from reality. As a result of this experience, I want to dedicate much more time to people less fortunate than me on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis.<\/p>\n<p>So I thank Los Amigos De La Naturaleza for teaching me what I have been missing in my life and I will be attempting to relay this to them in Spanish on Friday when they finish school for Xmas.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Why should anyone consider reaching out to help others in need?<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is the most natural thing for humans to do, but the world we live in encourages personal gains and a win at all cost mentality, this is contrary to our natural instincts as humans to help each other.<\/p>\n<p>Watch how by giving a little bit of your time and energy to someone less fortunate, you receive so much more back in return. A sense of deep happiness! This is worth more than anything you can buy. It is priceless.<\/p>\n<p>I know that your brilliant school contributes substantially to the Foundation and the schools in the Cazuka and myself and the kids up there thank you greatly for your generous donations.<\/p>\n<p>But I\u2019d encourage you all to think deeply about the living conditions of the children there.\u00a0What is the difference between them, you and I? And what could I do to help these kids realise their potential.<\/p>\n<p>We are all the same, we are all born the same, just pure love. It is our circumstances and surroundings which then shape and mould our futures. So let\u2019s work together and help change their environment, because this is what\u2019s going to help these kids rise up and continue to be beautiful, bright people of the future and make this world a more equal and fair environment for all.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share a little piece of my incredible life-changing experience with you today.<\/p>\n<p>Muchas gracias<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2753\" style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_0466-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_0466-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_0466-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_0466-1.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Reaching to help others in need is the most natural thing for humans to do, but the world we live in encourages personal gains and a win at all cost mentality, this is contrary to our natural instincts as humans to help each other.
