In reality, you can do much so more than what you tell yourself you can. People\u2019s fear and doubt about themselves can cause them not to. The first hike, I was struggling and crying the whole way up. I told myself I couldn\u2019t go any further. I convinced myself to give up. The last and longest hike I decided to change my attitude. I told myself I could do it. I told myself I could still go on. I taught myself resistance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2880 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2018-03-14-at-10.45.44-AM-300x169.jpeg\" alt=\"CGB Camps 2 - Y10\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2018-03-14-at-10.45.44-AM-300x169.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2018-03-14-at-10.45.44-AM-768x431.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2018-03-14-at-10.45.44-AM.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, it seems better to give up and to not try anymore but after my experience in camps, I can assure you that it will always be worth it. I will never forget the beauty of every mountain and how proud and rewarded I felt after every single hike.<\/p>\n<p>The second most important thing was to appreciate little things. Maybe just words of encouragement can change your whole day. At the end of the last hike, one of my classmates came up to me to say how proud and inspired they felt when they saw me be one of the first girls to reach the top and try so hard, knowing we all struggled so much the first time. This made my confidence boost and it instantly made my day better.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2877 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2018-03-15-at-3.58.01-PM-1-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"CGB Camps 3 - Y10\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2018-03-15-at-3.58.01-PM-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2018-03-15-at-3.58.01-PM-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2018-03-15-at-3.58.01-PM-1.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I strongly encourage you to sign up to experience an opportunity like mine and go to the CGB Camps.
