Despite the ups and downs that <\/span><b>we<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> all go through in a period of two years of IB education, nothing resonates with me more than seeing our students thrive and grow into very happy fulfilled young adults. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have been so lucky to have some of our alumni visit CGB this year, every single one of those that has returned to our school, has done it with a big smile on their face and with a range of stories that show passion and a sense of achieve<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">ment. How incredible to see that you have all found a path in life, that is exciting and that will gradually unfold into years of discovery and great learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what do I see in the faces of our alumni? I see happy, confident, empowered students who are loving their university experience and who I am sure will contribute positively to the world. And what else could I ask for? Well, other than the profound echo of, \u201cMonica, it was worth it!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, we all know that it wasn\u2019t always a smooth path for our alumni\u2026 it took determination, discipline and dedication to get there. Not to mention the tough love that I had to deal out from time to time to keep them on track, because the journey to the light at the end of the tunnel can not be achieved without an element hardship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3229 size-large\" style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-1.22.41-PM-1024x684.png\" alt=\"IB Ceremony Speech\" width=\"900\" height=\"601\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-1.22.41-PM.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-1.22.41-PM-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-1.22.41-PM-768x513.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, it is a combination of your talents and the privilege to be here at this school that celebrates and cultivates your stre<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">ngths and that has your present and future at the core of its endeavours.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Year 12 and 13, as it has been beautifully put \u201cthe best way to predict your future is to create it.\u201d And how powerful it is to embrace \u201cEducation as the passport for the future, because as Malcom X once said \u201ctomorrow belongs to those who prepared for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Our alumni receiving their Diplomas and Certificates today, were sat in those seats a year ago, and they were also filled with intrepidation and in some cases anxiety. But look at them now, they are continuing to build on a solid path to achieve their\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IB has certainly facilitated this process because they are extremely well equipped with the right skills, dispositions and attributes to navigate their educational journey. \u00a0But most importantly, it has prepared them, to be grounded individuals. We as educators must never forget that what lies at the core of what we do, is our ability to help shape our students to be solid humans who can think about their role in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was particularly moved by one student who\u2019s final IB year was surely the worst, of her life, both emotionally and educationally, however, her dogged determination and inability to be dragged down by failure, culminated in fantastic IB success. In the words of Maya Angelou: \u201cYou may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, and how you can still come out of it.\u201d In other words, those who avoid failure avoid success. Consequently, \u00a0it is important to understand our mistakes and learn the lessons they provide to us, in doing so you will become a more complete human.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3230 size-large\" style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-1.22.58-PM-1024x680.png\" alt=\"IB Ceremony Speech\" width=\"900\" height=\"598\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-1.22.58-PM.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-1.22.58-PM-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-1.22.58-PM-768x510.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">So regardless of how straight forward or steep your road has been so far, get out there and go for it!
