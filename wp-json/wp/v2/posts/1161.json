This was another wonderful performance, one that will form fond memories for all involved. I would like to thank every single member of the team for doing such a superb job and conclude with the following quote from Noel Coward;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\u201cActing is not a state of being\u2026but a state of appearing to be\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Mathew Lawrance.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">When I heard that The CGB Players would be performing The Great Gatsby I jumped at the chance to be involved as it is one of my favourite novels. However, I have been blown away by the passion, enthusiasm, hard work and talent of our students. Across the board from acting to making props it came together as an outstanding performance which reflected the teamwork of everyone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Thank you to all involved for allowing me to be part of this &#8211; I really did learn a lot and enjoyed every moment.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Ailsa McCreadie<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Being this my second year in the backstage team, I have had the opportunity to see how several students show the manual dexterity and creativity they have. It has been a great pleasure to work with the prop developers and the producers, without whom, undoubtedly, we would have not been able to have the synergy necessary to put up such an amazing performance. I am very thankful for letting me contribute in such a challenging but interesting and rewarding show. The show is over, but we are not saying good-bye&#8230;&#8230;just see you next year!<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Katya Tinoco<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Theatre has a magical aspect to it &#8211; people become transformed &#8211; and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of being backstage, helping with the making of the props, the designing of the backdrop and seeing students&#8217; skilful interpretations of the characters. The whole production could never have worked without a vast amount of teamwork and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the way in which every student played their part.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Angela Martin<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Working with The CGB Players is a real honour and watching the students perform on stage is awe inspiring.
