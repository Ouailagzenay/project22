Today I will be telling you a little bit about myself,\nand how I got to where I am now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the IB I actually got a scholarship that allowed me\nto go to University of Sheffield, in the UK to study English Language and\nliterature, which I loved and enjoyed throughout. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming back to Colombia was a little bit harder than I\nexpected, and it was partly because I had no idea what I wanted to do. In\nschool I had always been certain about what I wanted to study, and to this day\nI have no regrets, I loved my course but graduating meant I had to think what I\nwanted to do with it, and I did not know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also happened to return at a very critical time, which was\nfor the plebiscite on the Peace Accord between the Farc and the government.\nThat was the first time I had ever voted in my life. This was a defining moment\nfor me, because I realized I didn\u2019t quite understand the context of my own\ncountry. Even if we had seen it in classes and we would see internally\ndisplaced people in our city, I never knew what this conflict meant for others,\nand maybe that was because I never even asked myself what it meant for me. So\nwhen the \u201cno\u201d won, it really made me think that there were many things I did\nnot understand about the society I was in, and that I wanted to learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the first thing that made me question what I wanted\nto do, and the second was after I volunteered for a month in the Amazon. I went\nto a natural reserve, to translate for tourists and throughout that time I\nspent most of my days with the local guides and they were the ones that\nactually taught me the most throughout this experience. For example, one of\nthem was 20 years old and he told me about when he was younger he would go out\nevery night to hunt animals, because it was easy money and being young he did\nnot have many opportunities. It was only later that he realized the impact that\nthis had on endangered species and the effects it had on youth, as he said,\n\u201cthat would sometimes give me more money than what I\u2019m doing now\u201d. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These experiences made me realize that I wanted to continue\nworking with people, and do my best at helping, even though I did not really\nknow how.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I began applying for jobs at NGOs and I was lucky enough\nthat one of them needed someone that spoke good English. I began working on a\nproject with youth in different regions of Colombia to see how they saw the\nimplementation of the Peace Accord. Again, this was a learning experience for me;\nI think the youth we met with taught me more than I could have ever taught\nthem, from the efforts and activities they organize to build peace amongst\ntheir communities, to working with native bees to bring opportunities to other\nyoung people in their region. From the start of my work life to this date it\nwas been a whole learning experience, I have been able to travel and talk to\nall different kinds of people, from victims of the conflict, to ex-farc\nmembers, to Venezuelan migrants. What I can tell you from this is that\nsometimes we can do more by listening to others, and that there is a need to\ncontinue building on what they have constructed. Sometimes we may think that\nbecause we had the chance to have a better education or to travel the world\nmore, we know better, but from what I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s the people that live this\nconflict, that truly understand what can change their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\u2019m telling you all of this because what I want to say\nis that it\u2019s okay not to know what you want, and that it can be daunting to sit\nhere and decide what you will do for the rest of your life. However, it\u2019s\nimportant that you know that a number won\u2019t define what you do, or that your\nundergraduate degree means you will have a certain job. We can build and shape\nour lives as we go, and that\u2019s ok too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I have more clarity, and I just begun a post-graduate\ndegree in conflict resolution, at the Javeriana University. So my advice would\nbe to study something you love, and to try your hardest during these last years\nof IB, but also don\u2019t stress yourself too much. I remember crying over the math\ninternal assessment, and right now, I can tell you that since I left school to\nthis day, I have not seen one single matrix, (I plan for that to stay that way).\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for those of you going to University or those who have\nalready started it, enjoy it, you will learn about yourself throughout the\nwhole time and in my experience it will be way more fun than school. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, know that things will change along the way and that\nit\u2019s completely fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was my original speech, but given the current\ncircumstances I feel like I should touch on what\u2019s happening with the Peace\nAccord right now, and I will try to be as neutral as I can, as I know this is a\ndelicate subject, which has caused polarization from the start. From a conflict\ntheory point of view, it is normal that something like re-arming happens, the\nfirst 2-3 years are the most vital to a peace accord, and so it is not the\nfirst time it has happened within the framework of a peace process, and it will\nprobably continue happening across the world. It also doesn\u2019t mean that the\npeace process has failed, it\u2019s definitely important to highlight that there are\nstill over 10,000 ex-farc members that continue their reincorporation process,\nand that even after the announcement, have said they will continue this path.\nAnd if you want to actively support them you can look into their productive\nprojects, that include coffee, chocolate, hiking clothes, and many other things\nthat are worth looking up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\u2019s true that the peace accord has encountered many\ndifficulties, but I think our role, as young people in Colombia, is to try to\nmove towards it, we are the generation that needs to fight for this. Because I\nthink older generations have lost hope, and we cannot let this happen to us. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think generally, the world is facing a lot of\ndifficulties, but I also think youth are creating a change more than ever\nbefore, I wish I would\u2019ve gone striking against climate change when I was in\nschool. But it\u2019s your generation that is doing it, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s important\nthat you above everyone else, create awareness and influence change. Everything\nwe do is a political act, from the clothes we buy, to the food we eat, and as\nfar as we are aware of this, we are able to begin change that will undoubtedly\nencourage other people to introduce small changes in their lives. &nbsp;I can give you the simplest example, I began\nworking and always carried my water bottle, and in doing so my co-workers\nstarted carrying their own, and this means, they use less single-use plastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to try to conclude, my invitation is that you use your voice\nand your actions to try to make the world a little bit better and good luck in\nyour future studies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura Leiva<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alumni 2013<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colegio Gran Breta\u00f1a<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi everyone, my name is Laura Leiva and as you just heard, I graduated CGB in 2013.
