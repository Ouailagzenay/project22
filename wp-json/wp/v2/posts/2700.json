I met many people who came and went, and always waited anxiously for that new student to come in, wondering where they came from, which countries they had lived in, eager to learn about their culture. Knowing that once these friends left to another country, they would be friends I could count on around the world. This was something I came to discover was VERY true in these past 5 years since I graduated from CGB.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2702 aligncenter\" style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3081-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3081-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3081-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3081.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During this time I have had the opportunity to travel and every time I knew I was visiting a new place, I would go through my list of CGB contacts to see who was in that city at the time. And every time I messaged them, I was able to meet up with them, even if it was just for a cup of coffee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What is incredible is that I did not necessarily meet with people from my own year group, sometimes these people were former teachers, because something amazing about CGB is that the idea that we are a family sticks with us even once we have left the school. And although many would think we have nothing in common after 5 or more years of not seeing each other, we will always have CGB. A place which is a second home for us, where we were able to create unforgettable memories, but most importantly we were able to create lifelong friends. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2703 aligncenter\" style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3094-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3094-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3094-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3094.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So for you guys who are still at CGB, I say: take advantage of this unique place, where you meet new people constantly, take the time to learn about their cultures, but most importantly cultivate your friendships because these will be your friends around the world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So thank you CGB for giving me those friends who I can count with whenever and wherever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2705 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3125-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3125-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3125-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DSC_3125.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Maria Cecilia Cely&#8217;s words for International Day: Good Morning, When I was asked to say some words today as alumni, I was not sure where to start or what to say.
