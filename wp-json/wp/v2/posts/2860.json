I personally enjoyed the camp because despite the eternal walks, the heavy downpour and then the scorching sun, I was able to bond with people whom I normally don\u2019t talk to. I have a lot of memories about this trip but perhaps my favourite was the last day when we finally saw Ca\u00f1o Cristales and after a 2-hour walk we changed into our bathing suits and went inside the natural swimming pool. I will also never forget that first glance we took and saw that all the seven colours in the river that seemed surreal in pictures were even more vivid in real life.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2863 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/24058731_299902130504967_604055166573628083_n-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Y12 School Camps 2018 -3\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/24058731_299902130504967_604055166573628083_n-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/24058731_299902130504967_604055166573628083_n-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/24058731_299902130504967_604055166573628083_n.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And so, if you haven\u2019t gone to a school camp yet I encourage you to go to one. Camps are not like regular vacations, there are times where you face challenges like having your feet so sore you feel like you can\u2019t walk anymore, or it gets so cold during the night you cant sleep. But most importantly, however, is the memories you make with your friends that will last forever; because as the former Director, Mr Reeves, once told me when I went to my first camp: \u201cIn the end, you don&#8217;t remember what you learned in each grade, you remember where you went to, and who you went with\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to know more about the school camps, please <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/outdoor-education\/\">CLICK HERE.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Angelica, Y12<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good Morning, Today I was asked to talk about the school camps that happen annually.
