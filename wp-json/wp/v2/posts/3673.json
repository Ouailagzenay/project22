Wednesday though was the most important day, because on Wednesday we carried out the painting of the house of an old musician with the help of the Kids under Rahool\u2019s wing. But, before we started we played some games with the kids to get to know them better. The rest of the day we spent painting the house, cleaning up a nearby beach, and painting a meaningful mural for us to leave our mark on the island. Everything went well, even with the rain causing us to break for lunch and play some basketball with the kids, leaving us satisfied and happy by the end of the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto2-487x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3708\" width=\"244\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto2-487x1024.png 487w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto2-143x300.png 143w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto2-768x1615.png 768w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto2.png 571w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Last week the year 11\u2019s and\n12\u2019s went on their camps trip to Providencia and had a fun and educational\ntime. It was most definitely a trip to remember even with our early mornings\nand hot weather. The first day after landing in San Andres we took a tour of\nthe island on a Chiva Bus listening to the sound of rain and the speaker\nrepeating \u201cWaiting to the Bluetooth Connection\u201d on repeat. The next day we got\nan early start to the long and grueling boat ride to Providencia, some of us\nhad trouble coping with the sea sickness but we powered through. Once we\narrived though, we were greeted with the beautiful island views and ocean\nbreeze to relax our upset stomachs, as well as some fun and games on the beach\nnear our hotel. The next day we took out going kayaking and snorkeling, seeing\nthe dense Mangrove trees and all the coral that surrounds Providencia.\nWednesday was the day we went to paint the house but more on that later.\nThursday was one of the most challenging days of our entire trip, we started\nthe day off with a nice boat tour of the island where we stopped at several\nbeaches around the island, but in the afternoon was our hike up to the highest\npeak on the island, with logical name of \u201cThe Peak\u201d. Our climb up was hot and\nchallenging but rewarded us with a great view of the entire island, but on the\nway down we ran into some trouble because it started to get dark, though with\nthe help of some flashlights and phones everyone made it down in one piece.\nFinally on Friday we spent the morning reflecting on our trip, then making the\nlong journey back home taking us all the way into Saturday morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto3-374x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3709\" width=\"187\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto3-374x1024.png 374w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto3-110x300.png 110w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto3-768x2101.png 768w, https:\/\/www.cgb.edu.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Foto3.png 439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the main goals of our trip there was to leave as\nlittle of a footprint as possible, and help clean up the island. Throughout our\ntrip we made sure that any trash we created we kept and took back to Bogota due\nto the fact that any trash on the island will have to be shipped off because\nthere is no space on the island for a proper landfill. Also during our several\nexcursions throughout the island we made sure to pick up any trash we found,\nthough on Tuesday when we went kayaking we cleaned up one of the beaches there\nwhere we left with around 15 trash bags.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Breyton<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the island we met a youth leader, named Rahul, who was guiding some of the youth of the island to help protect their home and teach them about it at the same time.
